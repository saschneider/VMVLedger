      determines how your data is used) is the
      != "#{t('company')}."

      vote and does not identify you or contain any personal information about you.

    %p
      We do not intend for any of our sites or services to be used by children, and we do not intend to collect data from children.
      Similarly, we do not intend to collect (and we ask you not to disclose) any particularly sensitive data such as data relating to your health, religion or
      ethnic background.

    %h2 2b. How do we collect personal data?

    %p We (and other organisations that we work with, such as our suppliers and service providers) may collect personal data in a variety of ways including:

    %p
      %b Directly from you
    %ul
      %li Information such as name and email address may be collected when you voluntarily provide this information to us (for example when you register on the site).

    %p
      %b From other sources
    %ul
      %li
        We work closely with third parties providing services to us (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors providing technical, payment and
        delivery services related to the goods or services we provide to you, social networking platforms, analytics providers, search information providers) and we
        may also receive information about you from them
      %li
        We may combine information that we collect about you from other sources with the information that you give to us directly. We may use this combined
        information as described in this policy

    %p
      %b Cookies
    %ul
      %li
        Our site uses cookies to recognise you when you visit and use the site. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our site (for
        example, certain cookies help to remember your preferences) and also allows us to improve our site. Other cookies help us to tailor online advertising based
        on your interests and behaviour on our website and across the Internet. For more information on the cookies we use, the purposes for which we use them and
        ways to limit the use of cookies and similar technologies in relation to your browsers or devices, please see our
        != "#{link_to 'cookies policy', '#cookies'}."

    %p
      %b Through your browser or device or through our servers
    %ul
      %li
        Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, and we also collect your IP address or other device identifier (this
        enables us to recognise your computer or device when you use the site) via our server log files.

    %h2 2c. How do we use personal data, and what is our justification for doing so?

    %p
      We use your personal data for a variety of purposes related to the services that we provide. From a legal perspective, there are various reasons
      for doing so and we have set out an explanation of this below.

    %p
      %b For purposes related to the provision of the services that we offer to you
      %ul
        %li
          to provide you with the information, services that you request from us (i.e. to complete certain tasks), and to communicate with you
          regarding those services and respond to your questions and comments
        %li to measure user satisfaction

    %p
      We use your data in this way because it is in our legitimate interests to do so (for example, it is in our interests to measure user satisfaction and
      troubleshoot issues) but we will always ensure that your rights are protected.

    %p
      We rely on your consent to contact you directly about the services on offer on our site.

    %p
      %b For administrative and internal business purposes
      %ul
        %li
          to ensure that content on our site is presented in the most effective and relevant manner for you and for your device and to tailor the site's experience
          and content based on the way that you use the site
        %li
          to administer our site and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes

    %p
      It is in our legitimate interests as a business to use your data in this way. For example, we have a clear interest in ensuring that our site works properly
      and that our services are high quality and efficient. We will always ensure that your rights are protected.

    %p
      %b For security and legal and compliance purposes
      %ul
        %li
          as part of our efforts to keep our site safe and secure
        %li
          to detect or prevent fraud or other illegal activity
        %li
          as we believe to be necessary or appropriate in each case in order to comply with laws or legal process (including laws or legal process in other countries)
        %li
          to protect our rights or property (or the rights or property of others) and to enforce our rights and pursue available remedies

    %p
      In some cases, we will need to use your personal data to fulfil a legal obligation (for example, if we receive a legitimate request from law enforcement
      agencies), and in other cases (such as the detection of fraud or ensuring the security of the site) we will rely on our legitimate interests as a business to
      use your data in this way.

    %p
      %b International transfer of your data
      %ul
        %li
          some of the processes involved in our use of your personal data may require your data to be stored or processed in countries outside of Europe

    %p
      Whenever we send (or permit a third party to send) your personal data outside of Europe, we will make sure that we take steps necessary to protect your data
      as required by applicable laws. For example, we may implement specific contract terms or we may rely on service providers who adhere to certain compliance
      programmes overseas, or we may select service providers based in countries with strong local laws to protect your personal data.

    %h2 2d. How do we share your personal data?

    %p
      We will never sell your personal data or give it to anyone else for them to use for their own purposes without making that clear to you. There are, however,
      various ways in which we will share your data, as set out below:

    %p
      %b Sharing with organisations providing services to us
    %p
      We engage various third parties to provide services to us for specific functions, and this will often mean that we need to share your personal data with
      them (it is in our legitimate interests to do so, since we may not have the capabilities to provide these services ourselves). In each case, we will ensure
      that these third parties are only allowed to use your personal data in order to provide the relevant services to us. We will always make sure that we use
      organisations that we trust to look after your personal data appropriately and as required by applicable laws.
    %p
      Some examples of these third parties will include: website management, information technology and related infrastructure provision,
      auditing, and other similar services.

    %p
      %b Sharing data with online advertising related service providers
    %p
      We may from time to time work with online advertisers, social media platforms and advertising networks to deliver, tailor and measure advertising to you and
      others both on the site and elsewhere on the Internet (including on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter). We also use various tools and
      products which involve the sharing of data with
      = link_to 'Google', 'https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB', target: '_blank'
      to deliver, measure and tailor our online advertising.
    %p
      The personal data that we allow to be shared with these third parties includes online identifiers such as IP address, data from cookies or similar
      technologies, or other device related information.
    %p
      Similarly, we may share certain online identifiers with analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our
      site.
    %p
      You can choose not to allow your data to be used to deliver targeted advertising by changing your settings within social media platforms, or as described in
      the third party privacy policies set out above.

    %p
      %b Sharing data to comply with laws
    %p
      There may be scenarios where we are subject to a legal obligation to disclose or share your personal data, such as with law enforcement agencies or public
      authorities in order to prevent or detect crime.

    %h2 3. Security and retention of your personal data

    %p
      %b Security of your personal data
    %p
      We take the security of your data very seriously and have put physical, technical and administrative strategies, controls and measures in place to help
      protect your personal data from unauthorised access, use of disclosure as required by law and in accordance with accepted good industry practice. In order to
      secure your personal information, access to all data in this site is password-protected, and sensitive data is protected by SSL encryption when it is
      exchanged between your web browser and our web site. To protect any data you store on our servers we also regularly audit our system for possible
      vulnerabilities and attacks. All files stored on our servers are protected. If you are a registered user, to help us keep your data safe please choose a
      strong, secure password and keep your password confidential and avoid sharing it with anyone.

    %p
      %b Retention of your personal data
    %p
      In broad terms, we will only retain your personal data for as long as is necessary for the purposes described in this privacy policy.

    %p
      However, you are in control of your information options at all times and can choose to
    %ul
      %li If you are a registered user, you can review or change your personal information at any time, or cancel your account.
      %li Turn off cookies in your browser (see Cookie Section below to understand implications).

    %p
      As a registered user, you can review, modify or delete your data from within the profile section of the site. If you need help to do this, please
      != "#{mail_to t('company_email'), 'contact us'}."
      If you do choose to close your account, we will not store any information that could be used to personally identify you, and will immediately delete any
      content that was associated directly with your account. Please note that if your personal information was accessed by any authorised third party prior to you
      closing your account then we are unable to delete that information from their records.

    %h2 4. Your rights and how to contact us

    %p
      The law gives you a number of rights in relation to your personal data and our use of it. You have the right:
    %ol
      %li to ask us not to use your personal data for direct marketing purposes;
      %li
        to ask to see what personal data we hold about you and to find out about the way that we process the data (and in some circumstances, you can ask us to
        provide a copy to a third party);
      %li to ask us to correct or update any personal data which is inaccurate;
      %li to ask for personal data to be deleted in some (but not all) circumstances where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it;
      %li
        to ask us to temporarily stop using your data if you don't believe that we have a right to use it, or to stop us from using your personal data where there
        is no good reason for us to continue to use it; and
      %li
        not to be subject to decisions made solely on the basis of 'automated processing' (i.e. the right not to be subject to decisions made solely by algorithms
        or computers without input from a human) in certain circumstances.

    %p
      If you would like to exercise any of the rights listed above, or if you have any queries or concerns about the way that we use your personal data (or any
      questions about this privacy policy), you can
      != "#{mail_to t('company_email'), 'contact us'}."

    %p
      You also have the right to complain about our use of your personal data. You can contact the Information Commissioner's Office via their

    %h2#cookies 6. Cookie policy

    %h3 What are cookies?

    %p
      In addition to personal information you provide, we may also collect information about you automatically when you visit the site or access content in our
      electronic communications with you.
    %p
      The collection of information may involve the use of cookies and web beacons. A web beacon is a small graphic image placed on a web page that is designed to
      allow us to monitor traffic on the site or within electronic communications. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer's hard drive by
      your browser. Cookies allow us to identify your computer and find out details about your visit and browsing habits so that we can offer you a more
      personalised experience and manage, monitor and improve services.
    %p
      Most Internet browsers accept cookies automatically, but usually you can alter the settings of your browser to erase cookies or prevent automatic acceptance
      if you prefer. If you choose not to receive our cookies, you may not be able to use some of the core features of the site.
    %p
      The information collected by cookies and web beacons is not tied to your contact details (such as your name or email address), it only includes general
      information about your computer settings, your connection to the Internet e.g. operating system and platform, IP address, your browsing patterns and timings
      of browsing on the site and geographical location.
    %p
      You can learn more about cookies and how to reject cookies using different types of browser
      != "#{link_to 'here', 'http://www.allaboutcookies.org', target: '_blank'}."
    %p
      Separate tools are also available for managing local shared objects or 'Flash cookies' from the Adobe website. These cookies may be used to manage the
      effective delivery of services using video or other flash related content.
    %p
      While you do not need to allow your browser to accept cookies in order to browse much of our web site or to access many of our services, you must have
      cookies enabled if you wish to undertake certain services on our website or access any areas reserved for registered users.

    %h3 How we use cookies
    %p
      We use cookies for a number of purposes, for instance to enable us to simplify the signing in process for registered users, to help ensure the security and
      authenticity of registered users, to provide the mechanisms for online services and to enable traffic monitoring. This helps us analyse data about web page
      traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs.
    %p
      One type of cookie, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set once you have logged in to your account. The next time you visit the site, the persistent cookie
      will allow us to recognise you as an existing user so you will not need to log in before using the service. If you log out of the site you will need to
      re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. The cookie will also expire after two weeks and, once expired, you will
      need to re-enter your password the next time you visit the site.
    %p
      Another type of cookie, called a "session" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you
      close your web browser.
    %p
      Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit this site we automatically receive the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the site from
      which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave this site. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy
      server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your service
      provider. This information is used to analyse overall trends to help us improve our service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally
      identifiable information is never shared with third parties without your permission or except when required by law.
    %p
      Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website experience, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in
      no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.
