      offers the opportunity to check your vote electronically.

      The system has been designed by the

      as part of the Voting on Ledger Technologies (VOLT) research project. It is based on the Selene system originating from the
      != "#{link_to(t('luxembourg'),t('luxembourg_web'), target: '_blank')}."
      This project is concerned with trusted and transparent voting systems, and with the use
      of distributed ledger technologies to enhance their trustworthiness. Other partners of the project involved in the trials of the VMV project system are

      The code for VMV has been developed for the University of Surrey by

      The system also makes use of the
      = link_to(t('verificatum'), t('verificatum_web'), target: '_blank')
      system created by Douglas Wikstrom, and we are grateful to him for his advice on its deployment.  The system also makes use of the
      = link_to(t('quorum'), t('quorum_web'), target: '_blank')
      version of the Ethereum blockchain.

      VMV is a version of Ryan, RÃ¸nne, and Iovino's end-to-end verifiable voting system called
      != "#{link_to(t('selene'),t('selene_web'), target: '_blank')}."
      VMV has adapted the Selene design to integrate with the
      = link_to(t('ers'),t('ers_web'), target: '_blank')
      online voting system.  The approach to verifiability at the heart of Selene
      has been fully implemented.
